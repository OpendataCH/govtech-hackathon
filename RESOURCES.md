Awesome Swiss Data Sources
==========================

This file presents some of the main repositories of data in Switzerland in a brief overview, that we have tailored for participants of the [GovTech Hackathon](https://opendata.ch/events/govtech-hackathon/).
Every source listed on this page has an openly accessible API - which may just require registering for an API key - whose machine-readable endpoint we link to directly.
Earlier versions of this page can be found at [forum.opendata.ch](https://forum.opendata.ch/t/where-to-find-swiss-open-data/20) and [make.opendata.ch](https://make.opendata.ch/wiki/data:ch). Check out [Awesome Open Government Data Switzerland](https://github.com/rnckp/awesome-ogd-switzerland) for a more comprehensive list of Open Government Data (OGD) portals, websites, APIs, tools and other related resources in Switzerland and abroad.

# Regional portals

In some cases, data from Swiss cantons, municipalities or other geographical regions is being published on opendata.swiss, however some have dedicated portals with extra features or support options:

- [City of ZÃ¼rich](https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/) ([API](https://opendatazurich.github.io/))
- [City of Basel](https://data.bs.ch/pages/home/) ([API](https://data.bs.ch/api/v2/console))

- [Canton of Thurgau](https://data.tg.ch/pages/start/) ([API](https://data.tg.ch/api/v2/console))

# Commercial organisations

Here you can find some well supported data sources, which may offer service-level guarantees on their APIs and other features.

- [Wetter API](https://meteotest.ch/wetter-api) ([API](https://mdx.meteotest.ch/api_v1?key=AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF00001111&service=prod2data&action=sample_forecast)) from Meteotest is a reliable source of weather, climate, and environmental data.

# Non-profit hubs
